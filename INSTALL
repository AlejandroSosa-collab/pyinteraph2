=====================
Installing PyInteraph
=====================

PyInteraph is composed of a Python and C package (libinteract) and some front-end scripts.
The C library is wrapped for Python using a Cython wrapper. The latter has already been pre-compiled to C, 
so you shouldn't need to recompile it. However, the Cython (pxd and pyx) files are also included in the 
src directory in case of need or for customization purposes.

In order to build PyInteraph from source you will need

- Python 3.6 or higher with setuptools
- a C/C++ compiler (e.g. GNU gcc)
- the Python header files (e.g. package python-dev in Debian-based Linux distributions)
- several open-source Python packages

Please see the setup.py file for the complete list of requirements.

Installation instructions
=========================

0) These installation instructions guide you to install PyInteraph in a new Python environment.
They require that you have the virtualenv package installed system-wide. On Debian-based systems
 (such as Debian or Ubuntu) this boils down to installing the python-virtualenv package:

    sudo apt install python-virtualenv

1) create your Python 3.7 virtual environment, in a directory of your choice:

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.7 pyinteraph-env

2) activate it:

    . pyinteraph-env/bin/activate

3) download the PyInteraph source code and unzip it. Enter the uncompressed directory.
 
    wget https://github.com/ELELAB/pyinteraph2/archive/feature_py3.zip
    unzip pyinteraph2-feature_py3.zip
    cd pyinteraph2-feature_py3

4) install PyInteraph. This will also install all the required Python packages in your environment.

    python setup.py install

That's it! The pyinteraph, graph_analysis and filter_graph scripts should now be available.

Every time you need to run pyinteraph, just run step 2 beforehand.
       
Testing
=======

to check that your installation has been performed correctly, just run:

    pytest

inside your PyInteraph source code directory. You should have no tests reporting failures or errors.
