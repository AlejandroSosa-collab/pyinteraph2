Here we showcase the output of the PyInKnife pipeline (https://github.com/ELELAB/PyInKnife2) 
for scPSN as calculated on our microsecond molecular dynamics trajectory of CypA.

As the complete set of output file was too large to be stored here, you can
find the final aggregated outputs and plots:

* the configuration (*.yaml) files used for the calculation and plotting
* the aggregated results (aggregated_results_hydrophobic)
* the plots (cc_plot_hydrophobic and hubs_plot_hydrophobic)
* the script used to obtain these (*.sh)
