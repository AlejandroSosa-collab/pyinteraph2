This is an example of scPSN network analysis performed on a microsecond long 
MD trajectory of the CypA protein.

Here the scPSN graph has already been calculated using a 5.0A distance cut-off 
and filtered with a persistence cut-off of 20% (hc_graph_filtered.dat).

The graph has been analyzed by calculating network properties such as 
connected components, hubs and path analysis (see files in the folder 
and the graph_analysis.sh script)
