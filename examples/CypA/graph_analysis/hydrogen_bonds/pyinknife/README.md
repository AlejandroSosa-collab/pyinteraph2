Here we showcase the output of the PyInKnife pipeline (https://github.com/ELELAB/PyInKnife2) for hydrogen bonds as calculated on our microsecond molecular dynamics trajectory of CypA.

As the complete set of output file was too large to be stored here, you can find the final aggregated outputs and plots:

- the configuration (*.yaml) files used for the calculation and plotting
- the aggregated results (aggregated_results_hydrogen_bonds)
- the plots (cc_plot_hydrogen_bonds and hubs_plot_hydrogen_bonds)
- the script used to obtain these (*.sh)
