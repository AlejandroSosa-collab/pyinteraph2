Here we showcase the output of the PyInKnife pipeline (https://github.com/ELELAB/PyInKnife2) 
for hydrogen bonds analysis as calculated on our microsecond molecular dynamics trajectory of CypA.

We have used the same trajectory as the scPSN example, after fitering it by keeping one frame 
every 100ps, to save on calculation time.

As the complete set of output file was too large to be stored here, you can find the final aggregated outputs and plots:

- the configuration (*.yaml) files used for the calculation and plotting
- the aggregated results (aggregated_results_hydrogen_bonds)
- the plots (cc_plot_hydrogen_bonds and hubs_plot_hydrogen_bonds)
- the script used to obtain these (*.sh)
