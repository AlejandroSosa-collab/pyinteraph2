Configuration files
===================

Two configuration files are available to customize the PyInteraph analysis of hydrogen bonds
and salt-bridges. These files are by default located in the PyInteraph installation directory,
and the software automatically looks up to them by following the PYINTERAPH system varible.
However, the user can supply custom configuration files to the pyinteraph script through
command-line options. The format of the configuration files is detailed as follows.
If you want to modify the original files in the pyinteraph directory, please be sure
to keep the same file names as the originals.

hydrogen-bonds.ini
------------------

This simple file contains a list of atom names that can be recognized as donor or acceptor atoms.
Of course, the same name can appear on both lists. There's no need to supply the name of hydrogen atoms.
The lists are made of comma-separated entries, with an arbitrary number of spaces between name.

charged_groups.ini
------------------

This file describes the charged groups recognized by pyinteraph, for each residue name.
The first section describes all the recognized charge groups. Their names are arbitrary strings,
that MUST end with 'p' (lowercase p) or 'n' (lowercase n) in case the group is respectively, negatively
or positively charged. Otherwise, the case of the names is not relevant. For instance, AAAp, AaAp and aaap
are the same group. AaAP is not a valid name (uppercase final P).

Each group is defined by a list of atom names. All the atoms must be present in each group for them to be recognized
as such. However, atom names preponed by "!" must NOT be present in the group for it to be recognized in the topology.
The atom names are comma-separated lists.

The default_charged_groups are charged groups that might be present in all the residues, listed in comma-separated lists.

In the [RESIDUES] section, each residue is detailed with its charged groups, again in comma-separated lists.
