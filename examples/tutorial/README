The tutorial.sh bash script contains a typical workflow with the PyInteraph package.
The comments in the script detail the various flags of the main scripts
and give some details about the accepted inputs and expected outputs.
The file can also be executed to automatically perform the various analyses.
Please modify accordingly the first lines of the script if necessary,
accordingly with your installation.

After having run the script, it is possible to plot the resulting files
on the 3D structures of proteins, using the PyMOL included interaction plotter plugin
for the interactions file (salt-bridges.dat, hydrogen-bonds.dat, hydrophobic-clusters.dat)
or the xPyder PyMOL plugin (http://linux.btbs.unimib.it/xpyder/) for the graph files (graph-*.dat).
