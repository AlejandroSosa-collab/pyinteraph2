The Interaction Plotter PyMOL Plugin
====================================

Interaction Plotter is a PyMOL plugin designed to plot the interactions
identified by pyinteraph on the 3D structure of proteins. 
It is able to read dat files containing the interaction pairs and show them on the structure,
such as the hydrogen-bonds.dat, hydrophobic-clusters.dat and salt-bridges.dat files. For the IIN graph files
you should use the xPyder plugin instead (see the README for more information).

Insallation
-----------

After installing the PyInteraph package, the interaction_plotter.py file is available under the
pyinteraph directory, also containing scripts and configuration files. Use PyMOL's plugin handling
interface to install the plugin.
Please notice that the PYINTERAPH system variable (as detailed in the INSTALL documentation file)
should be set when running the plugin, as it requires the charged_groups.ini configuration file to be present.
If this variable is not set, the file location can be specified manually in the Charged groups file entry field.
If the specified file is not readable or invalid, the program will fall back to a hard-coded set of representative atoms.

Description and use
-------------------

The Interaction Plotter plugin plots the interactions defined in an input dat file, coming from a PyInteraph
interactions analysis, on protein(s) 3D structure(s) already loaded in PyMOL. 
The reference structure used when calculating the interactions is ideal to work with the plugin. 
Each interaction is shown on the 3D structure as thin cylinders connecting one atom per residue involved 
in the interactions. More in detail,

- For salt-bridges, it uses one representative atom per charged group
- For hydrophobic interactions, it uses the alpha carbons
- For hydrogen bonds, it uses donor and acceptor atoms 

The width of the cylinders is proportional to the persistence value in the input file. The color of the
cylinders also changes with the persistence value (more details about this in the next section).
A typical use case of the plugin is as follows:

1) install pyinteraph and set the PYINTERAPH system variable. Obtain the output files.
2) open PyMOL and load the reference PDB structure
3) specify an input file, as described in the introduction
3b) (optional) tweak the plotting customization options
4) click on the Plot button

the coloured cylinders should appear on the 3D structure.

Interface and customization options
-----------------------------------

Plotting customization options are available on the plugin's user interface, as follows.

Charged groups file: specify (if necessary) where the charged_groups.ini configuration file is located.
The default configuration file can be found in the pyinteraph installation directory.

Input file: specify the input file. These should contain lists of interaction pairs with their associated persistence, not graph files.

Reference object: if you have one or more PyMOL object or selections in your PyMOL session,
you can specify here the one that will be used for plotting. The default value is "all", meaning
"all the loaded objects".

Min (number): minimum value to be considered for plotting. All the interactions having persistence < MIN will be scaled up to MIN.

Max (number): minimum value to be considered for plotting. All the interactions having persistence > MAX will be scaled down to MAX.

Min (color) and Max (color): color for the minimum and maximum values, respectively. All the values falling within this range will be
plotted using a linear color gradient between the Min and Max color. Click on the Min and Max buttons to change them.

Min radius: Cylinder radius for the MIN value.

Max radius: Cylinder radius for the MAX value.

Plot object: name of the PyMOL object which will hold the plotted cylinders.
